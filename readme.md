# Intro

This web app is my attempt to recreate [Gumroad's widget generator page](https://gumroad.com/widgets) & also to try my hand at using Flight.js.

# Demo

[Click here to see it in action](https://gumroad-generator.now.sh/)

# Usage

The only thing that you need to use this tiny web app is a link to a Gumroad product page.
[Click here & play with it!](https://gumroad-generator.now.sh/)

# Features

- It can generate code snippet for overlay and embeddable Gumroad widgets.
- It has a live preview, i.e you can see your changes immediately.
- If it doesn't find a valid link to a Gumroad product page then it alert's the user about it and gives direction on how to fix it.

# Requirements

This web app assumes the browser supports most popular ES6 features such as `arrow functions`, `const`, `let` & `destructuring`.
